## Hey there 👋

We’re **HumansHive**, a small team of developers, designers, and 3D artists.

We build games, 3D models, and AR/VR experiences, working mainly with **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**.  
Our focus is on clean work, teamwork, and turning ideas into real, working products.

Right now, we’re working on a **VR project for a client**, handling both development and 3D assets.

### Tools we work with
Unity · Unreal Engine · Blender · Maya · Adobe Illustrator

You can reach us here on **GitHub**.  
We’re also active on **Instagram**, with **LinkedIn and a website coming soon**.

We’re always open to new ideas, collaborations, and client projects.
